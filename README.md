# The Meaning of My Avatar/Profile Picture

In case you are wondering, my avatar partially shows (or at least should show if GitHub works correctly) the flag of East Karelia (Finnish: Itä-Karjala). The flag was designed by famous Finnish artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela and it was proposed to be used as an independentist flag in the region of East Karelia. The flag of East Karelia is also the flag of Karelians.

The flag of East Karelia can also be considered a symbol of Eastern Orthodox (Christian) Karelian culture historically prevalent in the regions of East Karelia and Border Karelia (Finnish: Raja-Karjala). My maternal grandfather and his family were Eastern Orthodox Karelians who lived in Finnish Border Karelia before the area was lost to the Soviet Union for the first time after the Winter War and for the second time after the Continuation War. My maternal grandfather took part in both wars as a Finnish soldier. In addition, my maternal grandfather's mother and her family originated from Aunus (Olonets) Karelia (Finnish: Aunuksen Karjala), which is a part of East Karelia.

By displaying (a part of) the flag of East Karelia in my avatar, I honor my grandfather, his family and our shared cultural heritage. Additionally, I remember the cultural and socioeconomic loss that my maternal grandfather and his family suffered after they lost their homes and farms and became refugees within Finnish borders (Finnish: Karjalan siirtoväki/evakot). Unfortunately, the Eastern Orthodox Border Karelians were not always treated very fairly by most Finns after they relocated within Finland because of their different religion and because of their distinctive (Orthodox) Karelian culture. This is because the absolute majority of Finnish people are and were Lutherans and the Eastern Orthodox Church was considered to be culturally a Russian phenomenon and any reminder of Russian culture was a bitter thing for Finns to swallow after the two wars against the Soviet Union had just ended.
