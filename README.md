## My Family Name

My maternal grandfather Aleksanteri Luhtala and the extended family he belonged to lived in the village of Kaunoselkä in the former Finnish municipality of Salmi before the Second World War. Salmi was a part of Border Karelia (Finnish: Raja-Karjala). My maternal grandfather was a member of a large extended family of Eastern Orthodox Christians. According to information passed on to my mother, the family name *Luhtala* was based on the name of the house/farm (Finnish: tila) the extended family owned.

Recently published research on the changes of surnames in Finnish Eastern Orthodox Karelian population between 1818 and 1925 verifies this family folklore as true (Patronen, 2017, pages 244-245). Outi Patronen writes in her doctoral dissertation: "Muualla Salmissa vuosien 1890 ja 1920 välillä tilannimeen pohjaavan tai sitä muistuttavan sukunimen sai parikymmentä ortodoksiperhettä. Näitä sukunimiä ovat esimerkiksi nimet ... Luhtala (Kaunoselkä 1920; seurakunnan asiakirjoissa v. 1898), ...". Additionally, old Karelian maps (National Land Survey of Finland, 2009) [show the name *Luhtanen* clearly in the village of Kaunoselkä](https://www.karjalankartat.fi/?language=en&E=4617848.554557328&N=6828052.916638066&scale=10000&base=OpenLayers.Layer.WMS_4&text=Luhtanen) (screenshot from https://www.karjalankartat.fi/):

*Luhtala* and *Luhtanen* are some forms of my family name that can be found in old Finnish Orthodox Church records. The family name of *Luhtala* has then eventually become established as the official family name. Before the surname *Luhtala* was adopted, my Orthodox Karelian ancestors did not have a surname, but they used patronyms (i.e. a part of a person's name is based on their father's first name) instead.

As of September 2022, I have officially changed my surname to *Luhtala*. My previous surname was *Silvennoinen*. I have adopted the surname *Luhtala* in order to be closer to my Eastern Orthodox (Christian) Karelian cultural heritage and because I feel a strong connection to my maternal grandfather.

## The Meaning of My Avatar/Profile Picture

![The Flag of East Karelia](https://github.com/Jsos17/Jsos17/blob/main/640px-Itakarjalaisten_lippu.svg.png)

In case you are wondering, my avatar partially shows (or at least should show if everything works correctly) the flag of East Karelia which should be fully displayed above. The flag was designed by famous Finnish artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela and it was proposed to be used as an independentist flag in the region of East Karelia (Finnish: Itä-Karjala). The flag of East Karelia is also used as the ethnic flag of Karelians.

The flag of East Karelia can also be considered a symbol of Eastern Orthodox (Christian) Karelian culture historically prevalent in the regions of East Karelia and Border Karelia (Finnish: Raja-Karjala). My maternal grandfather and his family were Eastern Orthodox Karelians who lived in Finnish Border Karelia before the area was lost to the Soviet Union for the first time after the Winter War and for the second time after the Continuation War. My maternal grandfather took part in both wars as a Finnish soldier. In addition, my maternal grandfather's mother and her family originated from Aunus (Olonets) Karelia (Finnish: Aunuksen Karjala), which is a part of East Karelia.

By displaying the flag of East Karelia, I honor my grandfather, his family and our shared cultural heritage. Additionally, I remember the cultural and socioeconomic loss that my maternal grandfather and his family suffered after they lost their homes and farms and became refugees within Finnish borders (Finnish: Karjalan siirtoväki/evakot). Unfortunately, the Eastern Orthodox Border Karelians were not always treated very fairly by most Finns after they relocated within Finland because of their different religion and because of their distinctive (Orthodox) Karelian culture. This is because the absolute majority of Finnish people are and were Lutherans and the Eastern Orthodox Church was considered to be culturally a Russian phenomenon and any reminder of Russian culture was a bitter thing for Finns to swallow after the two wars against the Soviet Union had just ended.
